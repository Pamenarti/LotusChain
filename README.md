PRW -  Lotuscoin Core integration/staging tree (yes tree)
=====================================

This project is a fully armed and operational bitcoin-core ported to the lotuscoin network.  

Dedicated to Sipa, Nullc, and Coblee.  Props and Kudos.  

Three tasks have made this port complete:

1) Skein2 hash function for Proof Of Work inserted
2) prime256r1 for ECDSA signatures (including backport to OpenSSL and removal of libsecp256k1)
3) Logarithmic supply curve for long-term economics

Voila - we now have a segwit-enabled lotuscoin client in place for those who would like to use it.


https://github.com/Pamenarti/lotuscoin.git

Other clients including Lotuscoin-minimal and Fo-Realz-Lotuscoin are also available.

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #Lotuscoin-dev and #Lotuscoin.
